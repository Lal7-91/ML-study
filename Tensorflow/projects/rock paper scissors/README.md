## About the Project

Hi, I'm Saleh. I started this challenge about three months ago. Initially, I didn’t do much—just tried some simple sequences, hoping to find a solution without having to write a long code. Fortunately, I didn’t have the right sequence at that time.

However, three days ago, I decided to approach the problem more seriously. I spent around 4 hours writing the algorithm on paper, which really paid off. The implementation itself wasn’t too difficult, though debugging took a bit longer than expected.

Finally, I finished the project, and I’m happy with the result! I hope you like it too.
